==REACT JS FOR BEGINNERS IN ONE VIDEO BY PROGRAMMING WITH MOSH.==

* React is a javascript library used to create interactive user interfaces.(most popular user interfaces library)

* Heart of all react applications are Components :- An independent piece of user interface which can be reused multiple times.

* Every react application has atleast one csaomponent which is called the root component.(contains other child Components)

* A typical component in react is a javascript class which contains a state and a render() method.
Ex 
class Tweet{

    state = {}; // It includes the data which we want to display on the screen when the component is rendered.

    render() {
        // it is responsible for how the data shoud look like.
    }
    // Output of render method is a react element which is a simple javascript object that maps with DOM elements. It's not a real DOM element it's just a plain js object which represents that DOM element in memory.

    //-React keeps lightweight DOM representation in the memory which is called Virtual DOM.

    //-Virtual DOM is cheap to create.

    When we change a component in virtual dom, a new element is created.
    react then compares this element with the element in the real DOM and checks if both are in sync or not.
    If not then react automatically modifies the real DOM according to the virtual DOM element.
    
    //*This means that we do not need to work with the dom apis to change the dom elements in like in vanilla javascript.
    like there's no need to use querySelector() and addEventListeners();

    //This is the reason why this library is called react.
    because once the state changes, it reacts and updates the real DOM.

    React vs Angular
    
}

//Things to keep in mind while creating a component in react.
.   import react from "react" //before version 17
.   any one function (functional component)
.   it should always return JSX that's an element.

JSX uses camelCase convention. For example className, onClick.

Nested component -> component inside a component.
